# fillit

Second project for [42 USA](https://www.42.us.org/).

The goal of this project is to arrange Tetriminos to make the smallest possible square. The program will display the solution on the standar output.
This program takes one file. See this [sample file](https://github.com/ncaron/fillit/blob/master/tests/sample.fillit) for an example of what the file should look like. The program checks if the file is valid and if every piece in the file is a valid Tetrimino.
